  "summary": "Core navigation (home/game/summary), game loop, random question selection, and a playful theme are implemented. However, per-category backend progress tracking is not implemented, backend question bank is insufficient for 10-question rounds, and the required generated image assets are not present in the diff.",

      "requirement": "Backend question bank for Letters, Numbers, and Colors must have enough questions to support at least one 10-question round per category, with age-appropriate prompts and 3–4 answer choices.",
      "reason": "The backend question map contains only 3 total questions (one per category), which cannot support a 10-question round per category. Also, backend questions only include 1–2 acceptable answers rather than 3–4 multiple-choice options.",

      "reason": "Backend stores a single Progress record per Principal (not per category). Although updateProgress accepts a category argument, it is not used to track separate progress per category. The HomeScreen displays only one overall best score and rounds played, not per category.",
